# Practice Space

Practice Space is home to all my silly and micro endeavours on the programming language of Javascript. It is in preparation to becoming better in writing programs on the said language. For now there is absolutely no standard whatsoever except the fact that me and my gf have fun in testing all this code, but I am currently working on reading the book Clean Code side by side with this project. 


## Usage

Every subdirectory is a micro project and the root just holds a simple navigation index for these projects.
